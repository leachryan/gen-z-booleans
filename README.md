Watch out boomers and move over millennials. Your old booleans are in need of a glow up. ðŸŒŸ

Introducing Gen Z Booleans - a library to replace cheugy old booleans with dank ones, no cap ðŸš«ðŸ§¢.

## Boolean Replacements

Go through your boss's old boomer codebase and replace all your `true` and `false` instances with this sick equivalents

`fact`: replaces `true` 

`facts`: also replaces `true`, but more appropriate for certain dialects

`cap`: replaces `false`

`noCap`: inverse of `cap`

`no cap`: because sometimes camel case is ðŸ¤®

`ðŸ’¯`: sick emoji for `fact`

`ðŸ§¢`: dank emoji for `cap`

`ðŸš«ðŸ§¢`: lit emoji for `no cap` or `noCap`

## Extension Functions

Maybe `==` and `||` are too retro for your codebase. Maybe you like functions. Wanna see if that boolean or expression is capping? 

`.isCapping()`: Checks if that boolean is `ðŸ§¢`

`.is capping()`: Again, sometimes camel case is lame af
